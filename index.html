        </p> <p class="p2">In the wild, there are two formally recognised lion subspecies. The African lion (Panthera leo leo) is found in Africa, south of the Sahara desert. The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in one small population around Gir Forest National Park in western India.
        </p></div></div>

MALE LIONS CAN WEIGH 30 STONE</p> <p class="p2">On average, male lions weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone).  They need this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride. </p></div></div>

THE MAGNIFICENT MANES ON MALE LIONS TELL A STORY</p> <p class="p2">Most male lions grow impressive manes the older they get. These manes grow up to 16cm long and are a sign of dominance. However, not all male lions have manes. ‘Maneless’ male lions are common in parts of Africa, such as Tsavo National Park in Kenya. This is thought to be an adaptation to the local climate, as manes can reduce heat loss. </p></div></div>

LION CUBS ARE REARED TOGETHER</p> <p class="p2">A pride of lions is usually made up of related females and their cubs, plus a male or small group of males who defend their pride. The lionesses rear their cubs together and cubs can suckle from any female with milk. </p></div></div>
        <div class="box_l"> <div class="box_i"><img src="img/Lion sleeping in a tree.jpg" alt=""></div> <div class="box_t"><p class="p1">6. LIONS CAN GET THEIR WATER FROM PLANTS</p> <p class="p2">Lions are highly adaptable and can live in very dry areas like the Kalahari Desert. Here they get most of their water from their prey and will even drink from plants such as the Tsamma melon. 
        </p></div></div>
        <div class="box_l"> <div class="box_i"><img src="img/A rainbow appears in storm clouds over the Maasai Mara.jpg" alt=""></div> <div class="box_t"><p class="p1">7. LIONS ARE BIG EATERS</p> <p class="p2">Lions can eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal - around a quarter of their body weight.  Their tongues have sharp-pointed rasps, called papillae, which are used to scrape meat off the bones. </p></div></div>
        <div class="box_l"> <div class="box_i"><img src="img/Lions in Tanzania.jpg" alt=""></div> <div class="box_t"><p class="p1">8. THEY HUNT DURING STORMS</p> <p class="p2">Lions do most of their hunting at night as their eyes have adapted to the dark and this gives them a huge advantage over their prey. Interestingly though, lions also hunt during storms. The noise, rain and/or wind make it harder for prey to see and hear them, increasing their chances of a successful hunt. When hunting, lionesses have specific roles. Some play the role of 'centre' and others the role of 'wing' - the wings chase the prey towards the centres.</p></div></div>
        <div class="box_l"> <div class="box_i"><img src="img/Pride of lions.jpg" alt=""></div> <div class="box_t"><p class="p1">9. LIONS ARE THE ONLY CATS WHO ROAR TOGETHER</p> <p class="p2">Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar together - with even young cubs joining in with their mews. The calling sequence usually lasts about 40 seconds.  A group of lions, also called 'a pride', often roar together to mark their territory - a roar can be heard from 5 miles away. </p></div></div>
        <div class="box_l"> <div class="box_i"><img src="img/Large_WW215346.jpg" alt=""></div> <div class="box_t"><p class="p1">LIONS FACE MANY THREATS</p> <p class="p2">African lion numbers are thought to have declined by over 40% in the just three generations.

            The main threats are retaliatory or pre-emptive killing of lions to protect people and livestock; and decreasing natural prey populations and habitat (for example, due to expanding human settlements, agriculture and poaching of antelope for wild meat consumption).
            
            When their natural prey is scarce, lions can cause grave losses to livestock, which can massively reduce the income of local people.</p></div></div>
